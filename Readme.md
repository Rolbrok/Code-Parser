Code Parser
=====================

Today, it can only initialize integers, floats and doubles. And print them.

To compile:

```make ```

To run:

```./parser [filename] [-v] ```

TODO List:
- Functions
- Include files
- A standard library, with basic functions, such as print()
-  ~~1 array for all the variables, rather than 1 array per type.~~
